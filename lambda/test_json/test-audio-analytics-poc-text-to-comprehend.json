  "text": "call is now being recorded. Parker scarves. How may I help you? Brought a scarf online for my wife and it turns out they shipped the wrong color. Oh I am so sorry sir, I got it for a birthday which is tonight and now I'm not 100% sure what I need to do. Okay, let me see if I can help you. Do you have the item number of the parker scarf? I don't think so. It's called the new yorker I think. Excellent. Okay. What color did you want? The new yorker in Blue? The one that ship was light blue. I wanted the darker one. Did you want navy blue or royal blue? What's the difference there? Um the royal blue is a bit brighter. That's the one I want. Okay. What zip code are you located in? 1946? It appears that we do not, I'm sorry that we do have that item in stock at Karen's boutique at the Hunter Mall. Is that close by? It is it's right by my office. Okay. Um, what is your name sir? Charlie johnson, charlie johnson. Is that J O H N S O N? It's meant. And mr johnson, do you have the parker scarf in light blue with you? Now I do. They shifted to my office. It just came in not that long ago. Okay. What I will do is make arrangements with parents who take for you to exchange the parker scarf at no additional cost. And in addition, I was able to look up your order in our system and I'm going to send out a special gift to you to make up for the inconvenience. Oh, that's fun. Thank you so much. You're welcome and thank you for calling parker scarf and I hope your wife enjoys her birthday gift. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Goodbye. Oh, mm hmm."
